# 🎧 Online Music Streaming Server

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **secure client-server audio streaming system** using Python. The system allows multiple clients to request and stream audio files from a centralized server over a **TCP connection secured with SSL/TLS**.

It demonstrates key concepts in:

* Computer Networks
* Socket Programming
* Secure Communication (SSL/TLS)
* Buffer Management
* Performance Evaluation

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional file transfer systems lack efficient real-time streaming, buffering, and secure transmission mechanisms.

This project aims to:

* Enable **real-time audio streaming**
* Support **multiple concurrent clients**
* Ensure **secure communication using SSL/TLS**
* Implement **buffering for smooth playback**
* Measure **network performance metrics**

## 🏗️ System Architecture

```
Client  <==== SSL/TCP ====>  Server
   |                             |
   |---- Request (GET/LIST) ---->|
   |<--- Audio Stream (chunks) --|
   |                             |
Buffering → Playback → Metrics Logging
```

---
## Working of the System


1.Client connects to the server using SSL/TCP.
2.Secure handshake is established using certificates.
3.Client sends command:
    *LIST → server returns available songs
    *GET <file> → server starts streaming
4.Server reads audio file in chunks.
5.Chunks are sent over encrypted connection.
6.Client buffers received data.
7.Buffered data is written to file / played.
8.Metrics are recorded during transfer.

## 💡 Commands

| Command          | Description          |
| ---------------- | -------------------- |
| `LIST`           | Show available songs |
| `GET <filename>` | Stream a song        |
| `exit`           | Close client         |

## 🧪 Performance Evaluation

Metrics measured:

* Latency (time to receive first chunk)
* Throughput (bytes per second)
* Total transmission time
* File size

Test scenarios:

* Single client streaming
* Multiple concurrent clients
* Large vs small audio files
